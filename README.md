This is a short description of the project. It's current use case is to track D&D 3.5e characters, but with each component built to allow for some flexibility with other d20 systems (D&D 5e, Pathfinder, etc).   

This project is based in Python 3.7

Short term goals are, in order of completion:

1. Making the character tracker accurately track all information needed in a session. 
1. Include a GUI to actually be able to use it in a session.


Long terms goals include, but aren't limited to:

1. Add a sharing function / party tracker
1. Add support for NPC tracking
1. Integrate with a project like PyMap and get multitouch table support. (dream big, amirite?)
